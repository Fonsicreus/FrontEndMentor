## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use the buttons, although in the end I didn't use them, because I wanted to redirect you to the links and use the <a> tag. With that, I learned that there are tags with predefined styles and that you have to normalize them.
